## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 sweet Italian sausages (about 1 pound), pricked with a fork
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 Ambrosia or Gala apples, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* Salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions

1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the sausages and cook over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until browned but not cooked through, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the water to the skillet. Cover and cook until the water is nearly evaporated and the sausages are firm, about 7 minutes. Add the apples and fennel seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender and browned, 8 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper.
