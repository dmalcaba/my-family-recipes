I was thinking of a squash recipe that I ate as a child growing up. Â It normally comes with ground pork and I thought I'd try to do something different and use ground beef instead, less fatty.

## Ingredients

* ground beef
* squash (butternut or kabocha, whichever is available), peeled, and cut in small cubes to cook faster
* paprika
* salt
* pepper
* onion
* garlic
* sage
* fish sauce

## Directions

1. Fry chopped garlic, then fry diced onion until brown.
2. Add ground beef and spices and mix well.
3. Cook until the water evaporates and beef begins to brown.
4. Add the squash and mix well
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid for 10 minutes, or until the squash is cooked through.
6. Add chopped/minced fresh sage and mix well
7. Add fish sauce to taste.

## Alternative

* When frying onion, add chopped tomatoes.
* Add green beans as additional ingredient.
