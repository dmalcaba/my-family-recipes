## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 small to medium summer squashes
* 2 medium to large ripe tomaotoes
* 1 red onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1/4 fresh green chile, minced, or to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
* sea salt
* juice of 1/2 lime (about 1 tablespoon), or to taste
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (fresh coriander)

## Directions

1. In a frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini slices and saut√© until they just color lightly, about 1 minute. Then add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, chile, cumin, and sea salt to taste. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook until the squases are tender-crisp, a few minutes longer.

2. Remove the heat and stir in the lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with the cilantro, and serve at once.
